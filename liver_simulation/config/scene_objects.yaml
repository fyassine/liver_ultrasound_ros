# Scene Objects Configuration
# Single source of truth for environment objects in both Gazebo and MoveIt!
#
# Positions are relative to the robot's base frame (iiwa_link_0)
# The robot_spawn_pose defines where the robot base is placed in Gazebo world frame

# Robot spawn position in Gazebo world coordinates
robot_spawn_pose:
  x: 1.0
  y: -1.0
  z: 0.8
  roll: 0
  pitch: 0
